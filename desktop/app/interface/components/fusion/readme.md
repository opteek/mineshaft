# Fusion
Fusion Components integrate with external package dependencies. In other words Fusion Components, have dependencies, not explicitily defined within the application. Primarily packages will be managed via NPM, but may be added from other external sources like a Git repository or other (current/future) package manager.

While, a small detail, it's important for developers/designers to be concious of introducing new dependencies, managing complexity or editing/updating components using API wrappers for third-party services. To put simply, build amazing components, but do-so with an attention to detail.
